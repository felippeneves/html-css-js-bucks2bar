# GitHub Copilot Certification Study Project

This repository was created as part of my preparation for the **GitHub Copilot Certification**. It includes a simple web project built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, along with **Jest** for unit testing.

## 🎯 Purpose

* Practice writing clean and testable front-end code.
* Explore how GitHub Copilot can assist in code generation, testing, and refactoring.
* Strengthen JavaScript fundamentals and testing skills.
* Prepare effectively for the GitHub Copilot Certification exam.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) – JavaScript Testing Framework
